# Requirements :
- SQL for data base.
- Any Java IDE (Spring Tool Suite or Eclipse IDE is recommended).


# Steps To Setup Project :
- Step 1) Clone project into your system.
- Step 2) Import project on Java IDE (extract first if downloaded project is in zip format).
- Step 3) Create new data base of name <strong><em>“ traini8 ”</em></strong>. data base name can be custom but for this you need to make change in <strong><em>“application.properties”</em></strong> page in line “spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<strong><em>traini8</em></strong>?serviceTimezone=UTC” change traini8 into your desired data base name.<br>(<strong>PATH:</strong> src/main/resources > application.properties).
- Step 4) To start project on local server run <strong><em>“Traini8AssignmentApplication.java”</em></strong> class as Java Application.                                                  
          (<strong>PATH:</strong> src/main/java > com.traini8 > Traini8AssignmentApplication.java).
